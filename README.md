# image_encryption-and-decryption
this will encrypt and decrypt image.

There are two files attached. One of them  will encrypt image.

IMAGE ENCRYPTION:- This is achieved by rotating the pixel along row. 
The no. of rotate is predefined and no of rotation for near rows is different.
The no of rotate for every row is predefined and stores in a list. 
The person who have the predefined list which contains no. of rotate can only decrypt the image.
This rotate will make entire image a mess. no one can even correctly guess the image.

IMAGE DECRYPTION:- This is achieved by repeating the above process but rotating in opposite direction to each row.
After performing this we can get the original image.

In this process we converted the image into 300 X 300 dimention.
